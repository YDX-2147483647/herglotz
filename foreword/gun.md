## Чехов 之枪

整面墙挂满了枪，每把枪都不是谁刻意挂上去的，可竟然往往都有用。

Sherlock Holmes in [*The Adventure of the Dancing Men*](https://sherlock-holm.es/stories/html/danc.html) by Arthur Conan Doyle:

> It is not really difficult to construct a series of inferences, each dependent upon its predecessor and each simple in itself. If, after doing so, one simply knocks out all the central inferences and presents one's audience with the starting-point and the conclusion, one may produce a startling, though possibly a meretricious, effect.
